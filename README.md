Hello Everyone!

Just an enthusiast for technology, recently switched to linux os as to make the most of the lower power consumption.
It is also handy to have such a small unit with so much functionality.

Am looking to get to grips with how such a device can integrate itself and replace a lot of the usual candidates.
One thing that has been interesting to explore is what amazing work has been done already, but also to discover what works and what doesn't.

Been playing Transport Tycoon through Dosbox for a while which is always a form of nostalgia, other dos games may also work well. Yet keep the resolution to a small, widescreen output such as 720x480 to keep it running smoothly. 
Some of the older dos games are worth purchasing on cd, if you enjoy those.

Some compatabilities haven't really been explored, due to busy lifestyle, yet soon may find time to coding and making use of the gpio header, perhaps even try create a few scripts for circuits that may come in handy. 

Any suggestions are welcome.

Thank you community for commitments in open source

kind regards
